Remember all the class we have: Feedback [DTO, repository interfaces, repository implementations, service interfaces, service implementations, controller, MappingProfile and cshtml] (if there is any class you might need information about than just ask).

- Use class="comment-list-container" to show  up Feedback using api/feedback/feedbackpagination
- Add 1 button to forward previous page, 1 text box to input the page that we want to go, if there is not, return "page not found" and the last is a button that forward next page

- - Fix this whole script to allow nested comment with ParentFb attribute null means the parent and the feedback that have parentfb=feedbackId of a feedback will appear as child of that parent feedback. Add thing like Foreach feedback,... That allow maximum nested = 3 (include parent). Bellow the Feedback or reply which not reach the maximum nested will appear a reply button. Enter it would create a div allow user to enter their reply (submit reply)

- I want you to use the ItemCategory in Item table to make the feedback assemble follow class="categories". We already have function get feedback by id and yes it worked.

- And check the get all. I want the Feedback show in this format:

[ Username  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Datetime]
[ Itemname													      ]
[ Content 	 													      ]
